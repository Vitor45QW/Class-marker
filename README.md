The dev maestro is a tool to help begginners in the programming niche. I suffered a lot when i began in the world of software development and tech itself,
so I want to help my comrades that are looking for a better job and life quality like me, but struggle with the dificulty of certain topics, like: what language, what framework? where to begin?
There is where my dev maestro works. helping and guiding beginners like me.
